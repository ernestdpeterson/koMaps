# Google Maps api mashup using Knockoutjs

### This is version 2.0 so to speak :wink:. The first version was turned in as one of the final projects in my Front End Web Developer course @ [Udacity](www.udacity.com/). I am refactoring it to add back some functionality that I had to remove to comply with the rubric. I also have learned to keep my code a little neater :disappointed: so I wanted to make it read a little better.
